1)The dataset is imbalanced dataset i.e only 1222  fraudlent transcations reported out of 23k transactions

Handling:After training and prediction to check performance dont use accuracy as majority will dominate
use recall or precision
Approach 2:
Use sampling techniques like smote to make imbalnced data to balanced data


2)No dependency for fraudluent transcation on type of payment method customer is using in doing payment (credit card,debit card,paypal,bank transfer)

3)Product category also didnt have dependency in predicting fradulent transcation,age is also not showing that much effect but people whi are in age group 20-45 are more doing fradulent transactions as they are more aware of the latest technolgies in the market

4)Now comes Transaction amount this feature have a significant impact on the fraudluent transcations
5)All transcations are happened in the year 2024 so transaction date will not contribute that much to predict whether fraud happened or not
6)#Credit card trans have more fraud trans  so to mitigate that 3-d secure and strong customer authentication is implemented in our product
